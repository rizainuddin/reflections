When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	I'll find this process very useful when I change Mac between my personal,home and work machines. There'll situations where I don't have my files with me all the time. I'm more flexible and in control of my projects this way.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I wouldn't know what changes to the files were made from the various machines I'll be working on, my other collaborators on the project, files that I'm working on locally. I also would want a better organization of files and be in control of it.
